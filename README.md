# Social-Network-API
My challenge was to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their **thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list**.
I needed to use **Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM**. In addition to using the **Express.js** and **Mongoose** packages, I used the native JavaScript Date object to format **timestamps** when users created **thoughts** and **reactions**. This **Social-Network-API** uses a **NoSQL database**
so that the client's website can handle large amounts of unstructured data.
